# Detect poisonous mushrooms (Cascade Model)

**Hackathon** between Ubiqum Amsterdam/Berlin/Barcelona/Madrid to detect poisonous mushrooms from variables that can be detected from **Image classification** 

- **Goal** - Minimize false positives (poisonous mushrooms that are classified as edible)

* Random forest used to get the most accurate results
* Logistic regression (manually tuning highly probable posionous mushrooms to poisonous)

### Best result out of three cities
